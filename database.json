She gave us so many breathtaking locations to choose from and made sure that we were comfortable every step of the way. Typically our family photo shoots involve someone crying, whining, complaining etc….. not this one!!! We had such a great time and our photos show it!! Arika is amazing and you will definitely not be disappointed!!!! ",
